# Customer review prediction using Decsion tree model

In this project, we build a decision tree model that makes predictions for a target based on multiple features.

For this project we have gathered data from an airline company. The airline is interested in predicting whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given customer feedback given previous customer feedback about their flight experience. we'd have to construct and evaluate a model that can accomplish this goal. Specifically, they are interested in knowing which features are most important to customer satisfaction.

The data for this project includes survey responses from 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. The goal of the project will be to utilize a decision tree model to predict whether or not a customer will be satisfied with their flight experience.

Because we use a dataset from the industry, we have needed to conduct basic EDA, data cleaning, and other manipulations to prepare the data for modeling.

Following are the steps of the project:

Importing packages and loading data
Exploring the data and completing the cleaning process
Building a decision tree model
Tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
Evaluating a decision tree model using a confusion matrix and various other plots

#### This project was performed as a part of Google advanced data analysis program. The dataset used for the project has been made available in CSV format as well.
